# FsmTest
Test project for creating a FSM framework.

Hobby project to prepare a generic framework for statemachines. The idea is to have a generic part that is re-used for all statemachines in the application. The custom part of the framework needs to be adapted for every type of statemachine including mapping to inputs and outputs using pointers.
